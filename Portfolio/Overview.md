# Overview


Bristol children's hospital has almost 10,000 members of staff. The paediatric emergency department is the largest in the southwest and provides care for the most seriously injured and ill children in the region. The Doctors of this department are managed primarily by two senior staff members – Dr Robin Marlow and Dr Samantha Milsom – who are our clients for this project. They have asked us to build a new online rota system for their staff.

Dr Marlow is our primary contact at the hospital and is determined to improve on established practices. He has listened to the requests and constructive criticism of Junior doctors; and is eager to make some real changes that support them.

Dr Milsom is the creator of the staff rota for all the doctors that are on call. She has been vital in bringing to our attention concerns about the usability of a new system. We frequently refer to her feedback in order to build an application that supports crucial time saving functions and easy access to simple actions. They are an integral part when you must assign hundreds of shifts to 30+ doctors.

There is not one set way of making a rota throughout the hospital, so every department has come up with their own methods. We have been working directly with just the Emergency Department of the hospital; however, it was noted at the start of the project that almost all departments could make use of a new system.

## The current system and its faults

The current solution in the emergency department is to use a Microsoft Excel document to keep track of everything. Shifts are held in a table with a staff member as each column and each day has each row. Notes about each shift are added to cells in case potentially sensitive extra information is required i.e. a staff member was ill. The document itself is stored on a hospital network drive that can be accessed by administration staff, but not junior staff.

The main issue with this is that most users rely on emailed or paper copies of the rota. This means that many copies can immediately become out of date if a last-minute change is made. The rota must be manually sent to all those who need it, wasting a lot of time.

## Our plan

We have been designing an online rota system that builds upon the live solution and addresses the client's main concerns, as well as adding extra functionality. The new system at its core is a web application, for which every staff member will get a login. These accounts will each have different levels of access, the highest of which being given to rota coordinators. They alone will be able to create new accounts, assign shifts and see private comments about shifts. Junior staff will be able to view the rota and all shifts without the potentially sensitive notes. There is also a level of spectator which can only view the rota, without editing it or being part of the rota itself.

Aside from this, we have looked at many extra features to improve the user experience. The most important one considered was a printing feature that allows some users to directly print a weekly rota. While this may seem redundant, it is useful to have a quick offline reference in communal areas.
